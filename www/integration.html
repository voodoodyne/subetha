		<h1>SubEtha and your Mail Transport Agent</h1>
		
		<p>
			SubEtha currently requires an external Mail Transport Agent (MTA) to
			actually receve mail from and deliver mail to the internet.  This
			may not be a requirement in the future, but we will never ask you
			to replace your favorite MTA.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			You should be able to use any MTA with SubEtha, but the integration
			instructions will be different for each.  Since the developers all
			use <a href="http://www.postfix.org">Postfix</a>, that will be the
			easiest and best documented path.

		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>
			SubEtha is very smart about what to do with any mail that it gets
			hold of.  SubEtha looks at the envelope sender and the envelope
			recipient and figures out the appropriate action.  The only trick
			is getting the mail into the server.  There are two ways this can work:
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Inject the method from a script</li>
			<li>Relay into SubEtha via SMTP</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>
			Script injection is similar to how Mailman, Majordomo, EZMLM,
			and other mailing list managers work.  You can directly inject
			a piece of mail by calling a SOAP method or a much simpler
			HTTP inject interface that SubEtha provides.  This works, but
			it's often difficult to configure in MTAs, especially preserving
			the out-of-band envelope information.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The preferred method of injecting mail into SubEtha is to relay
			mail into the server via SMTP.  This is usually trivial to set
			up.  SubEtha has a simple SMTP stack (by default running on port
			2500) which accepts messages and "does the right thing" with whatever
			it receives.  This SMTP stack is not (yet) robust enough to be
			internet-facing, but it will happily speak to your friendly local
			MTA in it's native tongue.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			In either case, your MTA must be instructed WHICH mail should be
			delivered to SubEtha (as opposed to local mailboxes).  The options
			here vary by MTA.
		</p>

		<h2>Postfix</h2>
		<p>
			There are two recommended ways to integrate Postfix with SubEtha.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Postfix Domain Mapping</h3>
		<p>
			The easiest, and perhaps most ham-fisted way of integrating SubEtha
			with Postfix is to tell Postfix to relay all mail for an entire
			subdomain (or multiple subdomains) to SubEtha.  For instance, if you
			are happy having addresses like <em>one@<strong>lists</strong>.subethamail.org</em> and
			<em>two@<strong>lists</strong>.subethamail.org</em>, you can tell
			Postfix to relay all mail for that subdomain to SubEtha.
		</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>
					Edit /etc/postfix/main.cf.  Add this line:
				</p>
				<pre>transport_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/transport</pre>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Edit /etc/postfix/transport.  Add this line:
				</p>
				<pre>lists.yourdomain.com          smtp:localhost:2500</pre>
				<p>
					You can have as many domains and subdomains relayed to
					SubEtha as you wish.  Don't forget to set up the appropriate
					MX records in DNS.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h3>Postfix User Mapping</h3>
		<p>
			TBD, after we implement the postfix tcp: map provider.
