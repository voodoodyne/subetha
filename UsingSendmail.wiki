#summary Integrating SubEtha with Sendmail

= Sendmail =

This only allows you to relay whole domains into SubEtha.  You cannot have list addresses that share the same domain as personal mailboxes (ie, list@example.com and yourpersonalmailbox@example.com).

  # Add your domain to *access* file:
  {{{
  DOMAIN.COM RELAY
  }}}
  # Add a mailertable in *mailertable* file:
  {{{
  DOMAIN.COM smtp:[IP]:PORT
  }}}
  #  Rehash the files:
  {{{
  makemap hash /etc/mail/access < /etc/mail/access }}}
  makemap hash /etc/mail/mailertable < /etc/mail/mailertable
  }}}
