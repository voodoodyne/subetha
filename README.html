		<h2>Setup Instructions for Development</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Install JBoss 4.04+ using the installer.  Choose the non-clustered ejb3
				install option, it boots much faster than the clustered option.
			</li>
			<li>
				If you install to a directory other than the default /java/jboss-4.0.4RC1,
				you will need to set the ${jboss.dir} property.  Copy build.properties to
				a file called user.properties and edit ${jboss.dir}.
			</li>
			<li>
				Unfortunately JavaMail is not installed with the ejb3 option.  You need
				two files in ${jboss.dir}/server/default/lib - mail.jar, activation.jar.
				In addition, you will need ${jboss.dir}/server/default/deploy/mail-service.xml.
				For the moment, I suggest creating a second scratch jboss install somewhere
				with the "all" configuration and copy over these files manually.
			</li>
			<li>
				Edit ${jboss.dir}/server/default/deploy/mail-service.xml and make
				sure the smtp host is set correctly.  The other config parameters
				are unimportant.
			</li>
			<li>
				Download MySQL JDBC driver.  Copy to ${jboss.dir}/server/default/lib.
				The file should be mysql-connector-java-X.X.XX-bin.jar.
			</li>
			<li>
				Create the data source by creating ${jboss.dir}/server/default/deploy/subetha-ds.xml.
				Use ${jboss.dir}/docs/examples/jca/mysql-ds.xml as a template.  The jndi-name must
				be SubEthaDS:
				<blockquote>&lt;jndi-name&gt;SubEthaDS&lt;/jndi-name&gt;</blockquote>
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Directory Layout</h2>
		<p>
			The subdirectories correspond to various components:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				appmain - Build system for the main ear archive which gets deployed
				in the appserver.  No source code, just some packaging instructions
				and some metadata.  Depends on all of the other components.
			</li>
			<li>
				common - A common jar of utility classes, shared by all components.
				Includes some constants defined for the data model.
			</li>
			<li>
				core - The core business logic, implemented as a set of session EJBs.
				There may also be some service EJBs here.  There is also a special
				component built, a sar, which contains thirdparty jars and some
				configuration instructions to JBoss.
			</li>
			<li>
				entity - The data model.  Contains EJB3 entity beans and a simple
				session EJB Data Access Object pattern.  All queries are defined here
				as well.
			</li>
			<li>
				rtest - All junit regression testing code and instructions.  JUnit
				tests are remote clients to the core ejb interface.
			</li>
			<li>
				frontend - The front end web application, packaged as a war.  Contains
				JSPs and all other content, acts as a client to the core layer.
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Running Regression Tests</h2>
		<p>
			How to run the JUnit regression tests from ant:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>First make sure JBoss is running.</li>
			<li>
				Make sure the code you want to test is deployed.  <em>ant deploy</em>
				will build the latest and deploy it.
			</li>
			<li>
				Run <em>ant junit</em>.  All your regression tests will run.
			</li>
			<li>
				If you want to run just one set of tests, edit the junit.special.tests
				property in your build.properties or better yet user.properties.  Then
				run the <em>ant junit-special</em> target.
			</li>
			<li>
				If you want to run the special unit test(s) in the debugger,
				run the <em>ant junit-debug</em> target.  The JVM will pause
				and wait until you attach with Eclipse.
			</li>
		</ul>
