= How to Install SubEtha =

These instructions describe setting up a single, standalone instance of SubEtha.  You should have have installed JDK 1.5+ and whatever database you intend to use (MySQL and PostgreSQL are tested by the application developers, but any DB supported by Hibernate should work).

= Install Steps =

  # Create an empty database in your database server.  Note that SubEtha will create the database tables for you when it runs for the first time.
  # Download and install Resin 4.0.0 (or greater) as per the Resin instructions.  The resin install directory is in this document as ${resin.dir}.
  # Download and copy the appropriate JDBC driver jar for your database into ${resin.dir}/lib.
  # Download and unzip SubEtha into a temporary directory.
  # Copy se.war to ${resin.dir}/webapps/
  # Copy example-subetha.xml to ${resin.dir}/conf/subetha.xml (renaming the file)
    * Edit the configuration in this file

== Integrate with your MTA ==
Please see the MtaGuide for specific instructions for your mail server.

== Startup ==
Start up Resin by running ${resin.dir}/bin/resin.sh or resin.bat. The default web interface is http://localhost:8080/se/. When SubEtha runs for the first time, it creates a site administrator account named "*root@localhost*", with the password "*password*".

*Change the administrator password immediately*. This can be done from the web interface. In addition, change the site properties as described in the AdminGuide.

You are now ready to continue with the AdminGuide.
