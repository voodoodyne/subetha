		<p>
			For installation instructions, see <a href="www/install.html">the install guide</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Note!  This version requires upgrading JBossAS 4.0.4.GA with JBossWS 1.0.3.  SubEtha
			will not deploy without this upgrade of the web services component.
		</p>
		<p>
			You may also notice a small google ad in the dead space under the menus; we
			think of this as a small donation for our long nights writing this (free)
			software. If you wish to remove it, see the <a href="www/faq.html">FAQ</a> for
			instructions.
