= How to Install SubEtha =

These instructions describe setting up a single, standalone instance of SubEtha.  You should have have installed JDK 1.6+ and whatever database you intend to use (MySQL and PostgreSQL are tested by the application developers, but any DB supported by Hibernate - with blob object support - should work).

= Install Steps =

  # Create an *empty database* called 'subetha' in your database server (UTF-8 is a good choice -> [I18N]). Note that SubEtha will create the database tables for you when it runs for the first time.
  # [http://caucho.com/download/ Download] and *install [http://caucho.com/resin/ Resin]* 4.0.0 (open source edition) as per the Resin instructions.  The resin install directory is in this document as ${resin.dir}.
  # Download and copy the appropriate *JDBC driver* jar for your database into ${resin.dir}/lib. [http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/ MySQL] (*Note*: we recommend using a 5.1 [http://downloads.mysql.com/snapshots.php#connector-j snapshot] because 5.1.7 has some pretty serious [http://downloads.mysql.com/snapshots.php#connector-j issues]). [http://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html Postgres]
  # Download and unzip the SubEtha distribution into a temporary directory.
  # Copy se.war to *${resin.dir}/webapps/*
  # Copy [http://subetha.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/example-subetha.xml example-subetha.xml] to *${resin.dir}/conf/subetha.xml* (renaming the file)
    * Edit the configuration in this file

The default web interface is http://localhost:8080/se/. When SubEtha runs for the first time, it creates a site administrator account named "*root@localhost*", with the password "*password*".

*Change the administrator password immediately*. This can be done from the web interface. In addition, change the site properties as described in the AdminGuide.
